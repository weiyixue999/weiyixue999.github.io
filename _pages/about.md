## üí´About Me

I am currently a second-year M.S.E. student at [GEAI Lab](https://www.embodiment.ai/) of [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) and advised by Prof. Guang Chen. Before this, I obtained the bachelor‚Äôs degree in Vehicle Engineering at Tongji University.

My research background is primarily in 3D computer vision, with core experience in point cloud registration, 3D scene reconstruction and generation. In the short term, my research centers on investigating the intersection of generative models and 3D vision, with a specific focus on tasks such as 3D generation and scene editing. Looking further ahead, I am deeply interested in the potential of world models and their applications, such as in simulation and the integration with vision-language-action (VLA) systems.

    <br>
We explore the geometric insights of point clouds, which provide explicit registration priors for reconstruction. Based on this, we propose Geometry guided Neural LiDAR Fields(GeoNLF), a hybrid framework performing alternately global neural reconstruction and pure geometric pose optimization.
